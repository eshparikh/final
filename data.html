        <h2>Data Overview</h2>
        <p>For our analysis, we will be using the Student Performance Factors dataset, sourced from Kaggle. It consists of 2,392 rows and 15 numeric columns, capturing various factors related to academic performance. The dataset includes demographic details (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity), academic indicators (e.g., study time, absences, GPA, grade class), and additional elements such as parental education, parental support, and participation in extracurricular activities like tutoring, sports, music, and volunteering. This dataset provides valuable insights for analyzing student performance, identifying influential factors, and exploring strategies to enhance academic success.</p>

        <h3>Absences strongly impact student GPA</h3>
        <iframe src="absences_barplot.html" onload="resizeIframe(this)"></iframe>
        <p>This stacked bar chart shows how GPA distributions change with the number of absences. The x-axis represents the number of absences, and the y-axis represents average GPA. As absences increase, the proportion of students with lower GPAs (blue, 0-1.0 GPA) rises, while students with mid-level absences tend to have GPAs between 1.0 and 3.0, as indicated by the orange and red segments. A greater number of absences appear to have strong correlation with lower GPA, while a fewer number of absences appear to have a strong correlation with higher GPA. The chart suggests that attendance has a far stronger influence on GPA than study time, highlighting the importance of regular class participation for academic success, meaning it may be crucial in determining student success.</p>

        <h3>Study time has minimal GPA impact</h3>
        <iframe src="scatter_regression_chart.html" onload="resizeIframe(this)"></iframe>
        <p>This graph visualizes the relationship between weekly study time (x-axis) and GPA (y-axis). Each blue circle represents an individual data point. The slight upward slope of the regression line suggests a weak positive correlation between study time and GPA. This implies that students who study more tend to have slightly higher GPAs, but it is only a small effect. While the scatter does show a positive relationship between Study Time and GPA, it suggests a weak, positive correlation. Therefore, the scatter plot seems to suggest that study time does not strongly determine GPA.</p>

        <h3>Parental support and education improve GPAs</h3>
        <iframe src="heatmap.html" onload="resizeIframe(this)"></iframe>
        <p>The heatmap reveals a clear trend: higher levels of parental support and education are generally associated with higher average GPAs. The darkest red cells—indicating the highest GPAs—are concentrated in the upper-right portion of the chart, where both parental education and support are at their highest levels. In contrast, lighter cells in the bottom-left corner suggest that students with low parental education and minimal support tend to have lower GPAs. This pattern highlights the compounding positive effect of both parental support and education on academic performance. It suggests that when parents are both well-educated and actively supportive, students are more likely to succeed academically.</p>

        <h3>Moderate extracurricular involvement boosts GPA</h3>
        <iframe src="activities.html" onload="resizeIframe(this)"></iframe>
        <p>This chart suggests a positive but non-linear relationship between extracurricular involvement and academic performance. Students who participate in 2 or more activities tend to have slightly higher GPAs, with the peak observed at 2 activities (2.09 GPA). However, the GPA does not continue to rise significantly beyond this point, with students in the “4+” category averaging 2.08—only marginally higher than those in fewer activities. Notably, students who participate in no activities have the lowest average GPA (1.75), indicating that some level of engagement outside the classroom may be beneficial to academic success. The chart overall suggests that moderate involvement in extracurriculars may support better GPA outcomes, possibly by fostering time management, motivation, or school connection.</p>

        <h3>Musical activities correlate with higher GPA</h3>
        <iframe src="radial.html" onload="resizeIframe(this)"></iframe>
        <p>The radial chart indicates variation in GPA outcomes based on the type of activity students participate in. Among the categories, Musical activities are associated with the highest average GPA (2.04), as reflected by the darker color segment. In contrast, the GPA of students involved in Extracurricular and Sports fall somewhere in between, represented by lighter shades. Volunteering is associated with the lowest GPA. This pattern suggests that not all activities have the same academic impact—extracurricular involvement may contribute more positively to academic performance, possibly due to structured, skill-building elements. The chart highlights the importance of not only participating in activities but also considering which types may best support academic achievement.</p>
