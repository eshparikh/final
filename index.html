        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Success in the classroom is influenced by a vast array of factors, many of which extend beyond
            traditional markers like intelligence or effort. Academic achievement is shaped by personal
            habits, socioeconomic background, and external conditions that impact an individualâ€™s learning
            experience. Factors such as family income, parental education, sleep patterns, study habits, and
            screen time play a crucial role in determining academic outcomes. Understanding the impact of
            these variables helps educators, policymakers, and students make informed decisions to
            maximize academic potential. The goal of this project is to analyze key metrics of student
            success. By identifying the factors that predict high academic achievement, we can gain valuable
            insight into the broader behavioral and environmental influences on education, ultimately
            contributing to a more inclusive and effective education system.</p>
